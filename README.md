# Fitness App

This is a React application designed to help users manage their fitness routines effortlessly. By leveraging a modern UI with responsive navigation components, it optimizes user experience across devices.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Simulated local storage-based login and registration.
- **Responsive Navbar**: A dynamic navigation system that transforms into a drawer for mobile devices.
- **Dashboard**: Displays logged-in user's email and offers an easy navigation interface.
- **Workout Logging**: Sections for tracking and logging workouts.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: Core library for building user interfaces.
- **react-router-dom**: For handling dynamic routing in the application.
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and tooling for the codebase.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed to run npm scripts.
- **npm**: Node Package Manager, typically installed with Node.js, is required to manage project dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Fitness-App.git
   cd Fitness-App
   
2. **Install Dependencies:**:
   Install the necessary packages using npm:
   ```bash
   npm Fitness-App

3.   **Running the Application**:
   Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server to begin working    with the application. The development server provides hot reloading for quicker       development and debugging:
   ```bash
   npm run dev

   By default, the application will be accessible at http://localhost:5173. You can open this URL in your browser to see the app in action.

   Building for Production
   To prepare the application for production deployment, execute the build script:
   
   npm run build


   This will create a dist directory with compiled, production-ready files.

   Application Structure
   src: Main source folder containing components, configuration, and styles.
   components: Holds React components such as Navbar, Login, Dashboard, etc.
   styles: Contains CSS files for styling components.
   Deployment
   For deployment, follow instructions for your chosen hosting service (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages). The deployment typically involves serving the dist directory created after running the npm run build command.

   Usage
   User Registration: Start by creating an account via the register page.
   Login: Enter registered credentials to access the dashboard and other features.
   Navigation: Use the Navbar links and drawer on mobile for seamless navigation.
